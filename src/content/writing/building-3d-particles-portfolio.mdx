## The trap

3D backgrounds often fail for two reasons:

1. They **steal input focus** and make the UI feel sluggish.
2. They **burn GPU** even when nothing changes.

This template avoids both.

## Strategy

### 1) Keep the UI DOM-first

The canvas is:

- `position: fixed` and behind everything
- `pointerEvents: none`
- optional (auto-fallback if WebGL is unavailable)

### 2) Put motion in the shader

Instead of updating thousands of points on the CPU every frame, the vertex shader does the drift.
The only things we update at runtime are a few uniforms:

- time
- focus point
- attraction strength

### 3) Respect reduced motion

When `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled, the canvas renders once (static) and stops animating.

## Example

Here’s the core idea (simplified):

```glsl
vec3 drift = 0.25 * vec3(
  sin(uTime * 0.60 + base.y * 1.40 + s * 6.2831),
  sin(uTime * 0.80 + base.z * 1.20 + s * 4.2000),
  sin(uTime * 0.70 + base.x * 1.60 + s * 2.1000)
);

vec3 toFocus = uFocus - base;
float d = length(toFocus);
float falloff = exp(-d * 0.85);
vec3 attract = normalize(toFocus) * (uStrength * 1.15) * falloff;

vec3 p = base + drift + attract;
```

## What to customize

- Increase particle count to `12k` for desktop, decrease to `4k` for mobile.
- Add *one* interaction: nav hover subtly shifts the focus point.
- Use a calm palette. Let your content be the hero.
